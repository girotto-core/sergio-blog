# About Me: Sergio Girotto
**Founder of Enex & Honorary President of Enex Technologies**

I am an engineer and entrepreneur dedicated to one primary goal: proving that high-performance refrigeration can be achieved without harming the planet. Often recognized as a pioneer in the use of natural refrigerants, I have spent more than 30 years developing technologies that utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) as a sustainable alternative to synthetic gases.

## My Journey & Innovations
My commitment to green technology accelerated after the Montreal Protocol. I saw an opportunity to look back at natural solutions to solve modern environmental challenges. 

* **1999–2001:** I designed and oversaw the installation of the world’s first large-scale transcritical CO2 refrigeration system for the supermarket sector.
* **2004:** I founded **Enex**. My vision was to create the first company in the world dedicated exclusively to designing systems that use only CO2 refrigerant.
* **Technological Milestones:** Throughout my career, I have focused on pushing the boundaries of efficiency. This led to the development of the first flooded chiller in 2015 and the introduction of combined heating and refrigeration systems in 2018. 

I am proud to hold over **17 international patents**, including work on liquid ejectors and high-efficiency cycles, which are now industry standards for reducing energy consumption and carbon footprints.

## Recognition
While my focus has always been on the engineering itself, I am honored by the recognition my work has received from the global community:
* **Person of the Year (2018):** Awarded by *Accelerate Europe* for my lifelong contribution to the natural refrigerant industry.
* **Technical Authorship:** I continue to share my findings through technical articles to mentor the next generation of "green" engineers.

## My Current Role
After Enex became part of **Enex Technologies** in 2022, I transitioned into the role of **Honorary President and Chief Technology Officer**. Today, I work with our international teams to scale our sustainable climate-tech solutions globally, ensuring that the innovations we started decades ago continue to drive the industry toward a carbon-neutral future.
