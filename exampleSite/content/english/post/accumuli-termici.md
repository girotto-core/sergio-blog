**Thermal storage with PCM (Phase Changing Material) or with water?**

In the sector of buildings heating the choice of thermal storage system is a crucial aspect for the overall efficiency of the system. The two most common solutions are water storage and phase change materials (PCM) storage. These are different technologies, each with specific advantages and limitations, which must be evaluated according to the operating temperatures, the available space and the type of heat pump used.

**Thermal storage with water**

One system using water for heat storage is particularly effective when _ΔT (usable temperature difference)_ is in the order of _30 K_. Below this value, the required storage volume increases significantly, resulting in an increased footprint and space occupation.

With heat pumps that work with heat transfer at variable temperature, as in the case of  transcritical CO₂ heat pump systems, it is possible to operate, even with ΔT between 25 and 30K while still maintaining high efficiency. A typical example is the heating of water from _30°C  to 60°C_ in a counterflow heat exchanger, the gas cooler of a CO2 system. At 30°C, the heat is still fully usable both for space heating (typically at 20°C) and for the production of domestic hot water, considering that mains water generally enters the heat pump at a temperature below _20–25°C_.

The use of water as a storage medium also offers several advantages:

*   _lower cost_ than PCMs;
    
*   _operational flexibility_, as the storage temperature can be decided and changed at any time;
    
*   _better heat transfer_, without additional temperature differences, since the water itself exchanges heat directly with the heat pump and the heating system.
    

All this contributes to a _higher overall thermodynamic efficiency_ of the storage process. In addition, by working with high ΔT, it is possible to improve the _COP of the heat pump_, taking advantage of a lower mean heat transfer temperature, provided that the entire system is carefully designed.

**Thermal storage with PCM**

The main advantage of heat storage with phase change materials is the limited space occupation. This becomes particularly relevant when the available ΔT is  e\_qual to or less than 20K\_, a situation in which a water storage tank would require very high volumes.

On the other hand, PCMs have some limitations:

*   _higher cost_ than water;
    
*   _fixed working temperature_, defined during the design phase and not modifiable later;
    
*   _less efficient heat_ exchanges, as a further temperature differences is necessary, so reducing the overall efficiency of the system.
    

**Conclusions**

In summary, water storage is a more economical, flexible and thermodynamically efficient solution when it is possible to work with high ΔT and heat pumps are well designed and integrated into the system. On the other hand, storage with PCM becomes interesting in cases where the available space is limited and the usable temperature difference is small. The choice between the two technologies is therefore not absolute, but it must be the result of a careful evaluation of the operating conditions, the plant requirements and the overall efficiency objectives.
